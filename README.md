# OVERVIEW

This program combines multiple jpeg and png files into a single jpeg or png file.
Each of the images can optionally be cropped.

Sample out.jpg and out-crop.jpg are included.

This program does the following:
- reads the jpeg and png files 
- displays each of the images
- read the display pixels and create the output file

The image size of the output file is limitted by the display hardware.

# POSSIBLE FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Provide greater flexibility in the layout.
