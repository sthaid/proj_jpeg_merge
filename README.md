# OVERVIEW

This program combines multiple jpeg and png files into a single jpeg or png file.

Sample out.jpg is included.

This program does the following:
- reads the jpeg and png files 
- displays each of the images
- read the display pixels and create the output file

The image size of the output file is limitted by the display hardware.

# POSSIBLE FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
